            <p>Imperialist pig-dog! I will destroy you and everything that you stand for. There is no god but the god of Capitalism,
                and the capitalist god must die. Sometimes I wonder if you're really a human being but then I realize that
                you're not and that it's ok to be gay. There's a storm brewing and it's coming faster than ever. Now only
                18.888! I'm a very special boy. I require a lot of love and attention but in order to brew beer there needs
                to be some sort of yeast product. Four score and seven years ago our fathers made this nation and I swear
                to god if you fuck it up I'll be pissed. Charlie Chaplin was a communist and the great red scare was a capitalist
                myth. For all the people we forgot I don't remember the rest of that song so we should probably not sing
                it. Something something chungus.
